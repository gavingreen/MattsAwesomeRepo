                            tasks that are adaptable to multiple types of accounts and projects. EPM2 Phases and Tasks are linked to and supported by on-line documentation, guidelines and document 
                            stencils to provide users with a full set of methods and tools. These methods and tools accelerate the development process, maximize the return on investment, and reduce the 
                            risk of overlooking elements critical to the success of the project.<P>Each EPM2 Phase contains Tasks, output artifacts, associated roles, and supporting 
                            information and guidelines. Phase 1, Discovery is utilized at the start of a project to determine the initial scope and business objectives. Phases 2 through 6 form an iterative 
                            development process life cycle that can be used across product life cycle phases to produce phased deliverables. For example, if an initial prototype or proof-of-concept for 
                            the site needs to be developed prior to the first deployment, and the customer wants to add features in a release after the first release, the e-business product life cycle might 
                            look similar to the diagram in . The tasks and deliverables in the iterative releases would be tailored to the scope of the product deliverable for that release. <P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;</FONT></TD>
