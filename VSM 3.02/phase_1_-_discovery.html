      <P><B><!--(1010 & 1020)--></B>This Task requires you to fill out the <A href="./ProjectPreparationSurvey.dot">Project 
        Preparation Survey</A> and to gather information from the sales cycle 
        or other organizations previously involved, such as design firms. You 
        need to learn about the client's organization, business, industry, market, 
        competitors, their clients, and other key background information. 
      <P><B>Business Objectives</B>

  <P>Obtain any client information from the sales team or other organizations that 
  pertains to the project, such as high-level business goals and objectives 
  that have been defined for the project.  That information will help members 
  of the project team, both EMC and client members, to begin developing 
  a shared vision and a shared understanding of the project. 
  <P>Understand any preconceptions or expectations the client might have as a result of the sales cycle. 
Identify any product or functionality commitments that have been made to the client. 

<P>If any of the functionality addressed by Advanced Services workshops will be implemented, involve Advanced Services during the transfer of knowledge from the sales people to the professional services people.  
For example, it is not uncommon for the Globalization Advanced Service to be utilized before any extra software beyond the base EMC package is bought, or before the consulting team is engaged.

      <P>You need to learn about the client's organization, the client's business, 
        the industry, the market, the competitors, the client's clients, and other 
        key background information. 
      <P><B>Stakeholders</B>
<P>Get to know who controls the project's budget, and has the ultimate decision-making power for this project in the client's organization.  
Identify the key technical people for the project.  
Identify the Client Sponsor or primary Client Business Owner (CBO) for this project (see Task 1.2). 
The CBO will be the champion for the project and make the client organization aware of the project and its importance. 
The CBO will also facilitate the access by the Project Manager (PM) and Client Relationship Manager (CRM) to needed information.

<P>Define who will be on the project steering committee and control the Project Management Plan. 
For small projects this might be an informal group.  
For larger, more complex projects, however, the steering committee will play a significant role.

<P>Confirm what is inside and what is outside the scope of the work to be performed.  
Confirm the business or system needs that will be satisfied by the project.  
Determine what functionality is critical for the client. 
Understand the benefits of the solution to the client.  
Obtain copies of any existing descriptions of the requirements, objectives, or needs that will drive this project.

<P>Learn what criteria the client will use to evaluate the success of this project.  
Understand any critical project dates, what must happen by those dates, and the consequences for missing those critical dates.  
Understand the relationship of this project to the overall client organization. 
Understand any dependencies that will affect this project.  
Identify any known issues, assumptions, and constraints for the project. 

<P>Interview the appropriate client contacts and, with their assistance, complete the Project Preparation Survey.  
This survey helps you assess the client's readiness to begin the project.  
It also helps you and the client identify and begin to address issues that need to be resolved.  
This process also gives the PM the first high-level overview of the main application functions, and enables the PM to determine the skill sets that are needed on the project team.

<P>Verify that the client has access to the EMC Online Support System (VOLSS) including the ability to create VOLSS tickets.

<P><B>Risks</B>
<P>Identify any known risks for the project.  
Define the process that will be used to identify, analyze, build mitigation and contingency plans for, and manage the risks associated with the project. 
Define the mechanisms for tracking the specific risks, the mitigation plans, and any contingency plans. 

<P>Consider the following when you identify the risks that might affect this specific project: contractual risks, organizational-related risks, technological risks, risks due to size and complexity of the project, risks in personnel acquisition and retention, risks in achieving client acceptance of the product, and other risks specific to this project.

<P><!--1010.05-->Risk identification provides the opportunities, cues, and information that enable the team to expose the major risks that might adversely affect the project.   

<P>To identify risks, team members and key stakeholders should hold a series of brainstorming and open discussions to identify and rank the risks for a project.  
They should also identify the communication strategies for explaining risks to the customer. 
These risks will feed into section 4.3 of the Project Management Plan.

<P><B>Note:</B> Globalization projects will take significantly longer, so deployment and cultural risks must be planned for accordingly.

<P><B>Project Management Plan Section 3.2, Project Team Roles and Responsibilities</B>
 
  <P>In a consulting engagement, it is very important to identify the client's resources 
  at the start of the project.  These resources need the knowledge transfer 
  from EPS or partner teams, and should participate in team activities throughout 
  the project to ensure a shared understanding. Identify the client staff 
  resources that will be needed for the project team: 
  <UL type="disc">
<LI><!--1060.06:-->Identify staffing skill requirements.  
As a basis for identifying which available resources will be able to fulfill the responsibilities entailed in the project, it is critical to identify the skills required for the project.
<LI>Determine when each client resource is needed on the project, the level of commitment that is needed, such as half-time or full-time, for each resource, and the duration that each resource is needed. 
<LI>Identify which client resources will fill key roles prior to beginning the project.  
These individuals should participate in project team activities from the beginning to ensure proper knowledge transfer and common understanding.
<LI>Estimate the size of the staff that will be required for this implementation.  
This estimate will be a major factor in setting the client's expectations of the project's cost. 
<LI>Get the client's commitment to the dedication of the needed team resources.  
Client developers should be fully dedicated to the project.
<LI>Ensure that the customer, or customer's CBO, dedicates client resources to the project.  
The customer's system administration resources should be at least 75% dedicated to the project. 
  <LI>Determine whether EMC Professional Services or partners will 
   be needed to fill key team roles or act as consultants. <!--1060.05-->Contact 
   EPS Advanced Services about partners that will be participating in a 
   specific area that correlates to an Advanced Service offering. 
        <LI>On global sites, the customer should provide language and cultural 
   experts. Global sites are not just changes in language. Global projects 
   should have much more diversity on the project team.   Bilingual business 
   experts, translators, content production team members, and QA team members 
   will need to have the ability to participate. All phases of a globalization 
   project are generally much more time consuming than non-global projects. 
     
      </UL>

<P><B>Project Management Plan Section 5.1, Project Implementation</B>

<P>For section 5.1, Project Implementation, <!--1060.04-->decide if the project will have incremental, or iterative, releases.  
In most cases, the total functionality of a site will be implemented using a phased approach. 

<P><B>Notes:</B>
<UL type="disc">
    <LI>  If the project will be supported by consulting services such as consulting 
   partners or EMC Professional Services, part of the project planning 
   should be devoted to identifying the level of involvement, and the roles 
   to be filled. 
  <LI>If the Relationship Management Server (RMS) is part of the customer's planned implementation, then Advanced Services workshops should strongly be considered. 
RMS workshops cover best practices in personalization, campaign management, business and data analysis, and information architecture. Both the business analytics and the technical implementation required for RMS and related services require careful scoping and planning to be effective. It is best to take this workshop well in advance of the design and development efforts.
<LI>Projects implementing Multi-Channel Server (MCS), Comm Server, or RMS will also need additional time and expertise.

    <TD> 
      <P>A Program Plan is only necessary for engagements that have multiple projects. 
        Examples are programs that are built in time-boxed iterations of projects, 
        or programs that involve multiple web site projects for different audiences 
        that are built for a single client. 
      <P>A good project management strategy is to create a separate Project Management 
        Plan document for each project within the overall program. You can also 
        use the Project Management Plan document stencil for developing the Program 
        Plan. 
      <P>There are clear differences between program planning and project planning. 
        In an effort to take advantage of valuable new opportunities, organizations 
        often tend to launch projects as soon as the necessary agreements have 
        been reached, concurrently with existing projects. A common result is 
        that the responsibility for sorting out an array of conflicting resource 
        schedules and priorities often falls to the project resources and their 
        managers. One concern coming from this situation is that the resulting 
        locally set priorities may not be in synch with each other or, more importantly, 
        with the broader priorities of the larger organization. Differences between 
        planning projects and planning programs (multiple project scenarios) are 
        listed below. 
      <P>Project planning: 
      <UL type="disc">
        <LI>One project at a time 
        <LI>Focus tends to be on time and method 
        <LI>Projects may be dissimilar to each other 
        <LI>Need to minimize demand for resources 
        <LI>There is a finite start and end 
        <LI>There tends to be a single objective for the project 
        <LI>Resources tend to work full-time on the project 
      </UL>
      <P>Program planning: 
      <UL type="disc">
        <LI>Many simultaneous projects 
        <LI>Focus tends to be on resource management 
        <LI>Projects tend to be similar to each other 
        <LI>Need to maximize utilization of resources 
        <LI>There is no finite start and end&#150;there is a continuous work load 
          across multiple projects 
        <LI>There may be multiple objectives 
        <LI>Resources tend to be shared across projects 
          <P>The following items need to taken into consideration in the Program 
            Plan: </P>
        <UL type=disc>
<LI><!--1100.01:-->Define Release Phases Timeline. </LI>
        <LI>Address incremental releases of functionality.   This is usually driven 
          by customer time-to-market demands. </LI>

        <LI><!--1100.05:-->Define risk mitigation strategy for identified risks. 
          The goal at this point is to identify chief risks to the project that 
          are readily perceived from the start, and to agree upon a strategy to 
          deal with them.  Later tasks deal with the implementation of the risk 
          strategy. </LI>
        <LI><!--1100.06:-->Review Program Plan with CBO and Steering Committee.

While filling out section 3.2, consider the following:
<UL type="disc">
<LI>Establish primary ownership and approval authority, by role, for each project deliverable.
<LI>You need to pay specific attention to developing a team that has the skills necessary for specific development objectives.  
<LI>You should present team members with clearly defined goals, responsibilities, and expectations. 
A team member should account for each deliverable.
The Team Model document describes specific responsibilities for each role. 
<LI>Map team members to the previously identified projects and tasks, and identify any gaps between the roles in the project team.
<LI>The RMS, MCS, and many of the Advanced Services offered require specific expertise.
If you anticipate using Advanced Services in the project, get the names of their consultants and add them to this section of the Project Management Plan.

</TABLE>

<P>This step, owned by the Project Manager, requires entering information into the Change Management Plan section of the Project Management Plan.  

<P>Certain project documents, such as the Project Management Plan, Requirements Definition, and Functional Specification documents, must be reviewed and approved by authorized project owners before the project can proceed to those steps following the signing of the documents.  
A change control process that works for one particular project might not be appropriate for another project; larger projects might require more formal procedures than smaller ones. 

<P>These documents are the roadmaps by which the project proceeds, and they control the project.  
Any changes to these documents must go through a change control procedure.

<H4>The Change Control Process</H4>

<P>The change control procedure describes the techniques that will be used for prioritizing requirements, analyzing the effect of proposed changes, documenting changes, and approving changes.  The change control procedure also addresses how changes will be identified, recorded, reviewed, approved, rejected, deferred, managed, and implemented. 
And, the change control procedure identifies how any changes that affect delivery dates are handled.

<H4>Processing the Project Change Request (PCR) Form</H4>

<P>Generally, the change control procedure begins with someone identifying a necessary change and submitting it to the Project Manager via e-mail or other written format.  The project manager then reviews the change with the technical team and generates a Project Change Request (PCR) form, such as the following, for the change.

<P>After the PM and the authorized customer agent have both signed a PCR, the PM must see that the specified modifications are made to the appropriate documents.
PCRs can serve as addenda to the Requirements Definition document.

<H4>Put Document Revision History Appendix under Project Control</H4>

<P>The Project Manager also needs to be sure that any changes are described in a document revision history, such as the following example Document Revision History table.  
This needs to be in an appendix to the document that has been changed under the project control process, and the appropriate changes are then made to the resulting deliverables.
For example, if an approved change is made to the Functional Specification document, then the Document Revision History Appendix is attached to the Functional Specification document.

<P>This step requires you to complete section 4.2, Reporting and Communications Plan, of the Project Management Plan.  

<P>You need to describe the mechanisms, formats, frequencies, and information flow that will be used for communicating the status of the project work, progress of the project, and other information as needed by the project. 
In smaller engagements, this might be an informal process.  
In larger organizations, reporting and communications might be required to flow through specific, formal channels and according to strict procedures.  Also, many times in large organizations that do not adhere to strict hierarchies, and that have indirect communications, communications might present a challenge. Ensure that communication is not over-filtered by layers of management.
Establish the practice of formally taking notes at all meetings and posting the notes where other team members can refer to them.

<P>Discuss status reports, conference calls, emergency contact numbers, instant messaging, and so on.

<P>This step requires you to complete the Risk Management Plan section of the Project Management Plan, and to establish a risk log and a procedure for entering information into the risk log.

<P>Depending on the size of the company, this might be an informal process, but should always be addressed.  
Risk planning involves examining how much is known about a risk, and what the potential effect of the risk is.  
When analyzing a specific risk, ask yourself if the risk can be avoided entirely, or if the customer can accept the risk.  
The plan should include ways to reduce the likelihood of the risk, and to determine ways to reduce the effect should the risk materialize.

<P>You need to describe the process that will be used to identify, analyze, build mitigation and contingency plans for, and manage the risks associated with the project. 
Describe the mechanisms for tracking the specific risks, the mitigation plans, and the contingency plans. 

<P>Consider the following when you identify the risks that might affect this specific project: 
<UL type="disc">
<LI>contractual risks, 
<LI>organization-related risks, 
<LI>technological risks, 
<LI>risks due to size and complexity of the project, 
<LI>risks in personnel acquisition and retention, 
<LI>risks in achieving customer acceptance of the product, and
