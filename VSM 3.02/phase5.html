      <P>This Task requires you to setup the site for access by a number of 
      people for the purpose of beta testing. Production-simulation, or beta, 
      testing is designed to simulate the production environment and 
      conditions.&nbsp; 
      <P>Solicit feedback about the site from the beta testers. &nbsp; You might 
        create a short questionnaire or rating form, with a place for their freeform 
        comments, that they complete after they finish testing the site. &nbsp; 
        To improve the response rate, you could offer them discounts, gifts, or 
        contest entries for prizes when they submit a completed questionnaire. 
      <P>Ideally, you should solicit a set of beta testers who represent the 
      expected users of the site. These expected users can include: 
      <UL type="disc">
        <LI>Internal customers 
        <LI>External customers 
        <LI>Customers using wireless access to the site 
        <LI>Customers with physical handicaps 
        <LI>Customers using various operating systems, browsers, screen sizes, 
        resolutions, and pointing devices 
        <LI>Customers who are native speakers of the target languages to which 
        the site has been translated, for globalized sites 
        <LI>Customers in other countries 
        <LI>CMA users who will be entering content 
        <LI>CMA users who will not be entering content 
        <LI>CDA users who will be entering content 
        <LI>CDA users who will not be entering content 
        <LI>Be sure to include people to review the site that are not part of

      <P>This Task requires running the performance tests and scripts that were 
        developed for the Test Plan document, analyzing the results, and then

        abnormally heavy volumes of activity for a short period of time. &nbsp; 
        Load testing is subjecting the component or system to heavy, but not 
        abnormally heavy, volumes of activity for an extended period of time.
