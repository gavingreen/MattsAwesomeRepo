      <P>For this step, you first take the Business and Functional Questions 
   from the Questions for Gathering Client Requirements guide, and get 
   answers from the customer. Then, you take those answers and use them to 
   complete section 3.1, Business Requirements, of the Requirements 
   Definition document. 
   <P>Business requirements are the high-level objectives of the organization 
    or customer requesting the EMC application.&nbsp; They capture the 
    project's vision or scope.&nbsp; Typical business requirements describe 
    the financial, marketplace, or other business benefits that either the 
    customer or the project owner can gain from the Web site 
   <P>Business objectives can include: 
   <UL type="disc">
      <LI> Scope of the project 
    <LI>Primary goal and desired goals 
    <LI>Customer satisfaction success metrics 
    <LI>Target completion date 
    <LI>General cost assumptions </LI></UL>
      <P>Identify the business initiatives the business is undertaking and how 
   those initiatives will affect the site.&nbsp; The customer should provide 
   business experts to help define these requirements. 
   <P>Document the business requirements in terms of the metrics or criteria 
   that will be used by the client to measure the success of the 
   project.&nbsp; An example could be the following: 
   <P>"It is a requirement that we reduce annual inventory tracking costs the 
   first year after implementing the new system." 
   <P>Consider using measurements of success such as the following: 
   <UL type="disc">
      <LI> One-time cost savings or long-term cost savings 
    <LI>Web-generated revenue per week or month 
    <LI>Number of referrals per week or month 
    <LI>Number of affiliates or syndication partners 
    <LI>Number of transactions per hour or day 
    <LI>Average response time 
    <LI>Conversion rate of looker-to-booker ratio 
    <LI>Average duration of workflow 
    <LI>User's duration on site 
    <LI>Stage of personalization 
    <LI>Number of registered customers 
    <LI>Average page throughput </LI></UL>

      <P>This task requires you to complete the Constraints and Assumptions 
   sections of the Requirements Definition.&nbsp; Here you describe 
   assumptions on which the project is based, and describe any constraints 
   that have been imposed in areas such as schedule, budget, resources, 
   products to be reused, technology to be employed, products to be acquired, 
   and interfaces with other products. 
   <P>Constraints are conditions that legitimately limit the choices available 
    to the designers or programmers.&nbsp; These are nonfunctional requirements.&nbsp; 
    A constraint is a definition of our understanding of the limitations on 
    the system.&nbsp; Each constraint must be clear, unambiguous, and discrete.&nbsp; 
    You can organize the constraints into groupings similar to the requirement 
    groupings, or you can simply list them individually under the Constraints 
    heading.&nbsp; Each constraint must have a unique number so it can be 
    referenced later.&nbsp; Try to prevent the customer from imposing unnecessary 
    constraints, since they can prevent you from creating the best solution. 
    An example is "No cookies may be placed on the user's system." 
   <P>Assumptions are conditions that the developers and other team members 
   presume to be true about the project.&nbsp; Assumptions can either be in a 
   positive or negative context.&nbsp; Following are examples: 
   <P>"It is an assumption that project <I>x</I> will be deployed on a 
   Windows NT system with 512 MB of memory." 
   <P>"It is not a requirement that the global search will encompass flat 
   file structures located on the xyz server." </P></TD></TR><!-- Row inserted for space -->

   <P>Those responsible for business requirements and data availability 
   should meet with budget representatives to decide the depth of the RMS 
   strategy.&nbsp; At this point you should discuss the levels of RMS 
   implementation. 
   <P>Data Sources: 
   <UL type="disc">
      <LI> Sessions:&nbsp;Observation Manager Daemon (OMD) log, for session 
    times 
    <LI>Profile Marks: Custom WebSite system database, for profile mark hierarchy, OMD 
    log for Profile Mark event 
    <LI>Campaigns: Custom WebSite System database, for Campaign Definitions and 
    hierarchy, OMD log for Campaign Events and Exposures, Responses, 
    Feedback 
    <LI>Visitor Summary-Attributes are client supplied 
    <LI>Product-Item hierarchy is client supplied 
    <LI>Point-of-Sale transactions are client supplied 
    <LI>Customer Visitor Mapping is client supplied 
    <LI>Channels-Location Hierarchy is client supplied for locations; Custom WebSite 
    defaults to 7 predefined channels. </LI></UL>
      <H3><!--3125.01:-->Perform RMS Session Analysis</H3>
      <P>Data sources for RMS session analysis include: 
   <UL type="disc">
      <LI> Session data and analysis: in order to get the most accurate 
    statistics for a session, the use of profile marks on each entry and 
    exit page will help. 
    <LI>Profile mark definitions and hits: profile marks can be associated 
    with templates, content and projects.&nbsp; Profile marks provide the 
    three levels of hierarchy of All, Category, and&nbsp; Keyword. 
    <LI>Campaign definitions and results analysis should be defined as part 
    of the overall content workflow process in order to review the content, 
    segments, rules, and triggers for the campaign. 
    <LI>Clustering: using profile marks, session measures, and session 
    ranks. </LI></UL>
      <P>The first level of implementation should not require data 
   mapping.&nbsp; All of the data sources required for this level are 
   supplied from the Custom WebSite platform. &nbsp; 
   <P><B>Note:</B> The system has to be configured to know where the Custom WebSite 
   system database and the OM log is located. 
   <H3><!--3125.02: -->Perform RMS Customer Profile Analysis</H3>
      <P>Additional customer attributes can be imported into the database to 
   support additional clustering attributes. 
   <H3><!--3125.03: -->Perform RMS Customer Transaction Analysis</H3>
      <P>Customer Transaction Analysis includes the following data sources: 
   <UL type="disc">
      <LI> Customer&nbsp;point-of-sale transactions 
    <LI>Product and item hierarchy 
    <LI>Customer and visitor mapping:&nbsp; CMS logs a 32-character visitor 
    ID that is tracked throughout the entire session.&nbsp; Other mechanisms 
    include cookies, login-registration, and random-anonymous IDs.&nbsp; 
    Defining a new table to keep any new visitor attributes should be 
    separate from the visitor table in the system.&nbsp; This minimizes the 
    performance risk and aids in future upgrades. 
    <LI>Clustering, or using transaction measures and transaction 
    ranks.&nbsp; In order to minimize effort required to collect transaction 
    data, and to maximize any existing procedures or models the client has 
    developed, a customer-visitor mapping table added to Level 2 
    implementation can add significant value to the clustering capability. 
    </LI></UL>
      <H3><!--3125.04:-->Perform RMS Content Analysis</H3>
      <P>Includes the base level data sources and content analysis using a flat 
   hierarchy definition. 
   <P>A variation of this implementation is to work with the client to use 
    either an existing multilevel content hierarchy or to build one.&nbsp; 
    This potentially could be done by parsing historical web logs to build 
    the hierarchy.</P>

    the Requirements Definition Document, section 3.12. To do so, determine 
    whether e-mail, cell phones, or pagers will be used in the information 
    flow of the site. 
   <P>Identify the business objectives for wireless or Multi-Channel 
   Distribution (MCD).&nbsp; Assess how the proposed MCD solution will affect 
   the business.&nbsp; Consider the impact of proprietary telecommunications 
   carriers, intermediary service providers, and a multitude of device 
   manufacturers.&nbsp; Define how MCD will be used to meet the client's 
   business goals. 
   <P>These requirements should specify the devices that will be supported, 
   the protocols that will be used, and the types of content to be 
   transmitted to the devices. 
   <P>In order to understand and document requirements for a web-based 
   e-business solution incorporating wireless or MCD, first identify the 
   possibilities that exist for MCD.&nbsp; This is necessary to accurately 
   define the business objectives for MCD, or assess how the proposed 
   solution will affect the business.&nbsp; MCD can be a confusing topic 
   because of proprietary telecommunications carriers, intermediary service 
   providers, and a multitude of device manufacturers.&nbsp; Successful 
   deployment of multi-channel applications will be critical in both consumer 
   and B2B environments. 
   <P>If the site will use the Communication Server, you need to detail its 
    architecture. The Communication Server uses three primary channels: e-mail, 
    cell phone, and pager.&nbsp; In most instances it is easiest to use e-mail 
    for the first Communication Server experience.&nbsp; This will help minimize 
    technical distribution issues. </P>

      <P>This task requires you to complete the CMA Requirements section of the 
      Requirements Definition document. 
      <P>The CMA will provide the ability to separate the management of content 
      from its presentation. A browser-based CMA permits distributed content 
      management, so content editors can be geographically distributed. 
      <P>The analysis of CMA requirements should include identifying the content 
      items that will be displayed together in each functional area of the site, 
      and any additional information that will be needed to support the display 
      of those items. You also need to consider logical groupings of similar 
      content items that can be processed in a similar manner. A product 
      description in a catalog is an example of a logical grouping of content 
      items. 
      <P>For each logical content group, determine how the content is created 
      for the items. Is all or some of the content extracted from an existing 
      database? What groups are responsible for creating the content, and who is 
      responsible for editing the content once it has been created? Define the 
      content lifecycle, and how the status of the content will change. It is 
      useful to develop a state diagram of the content lifecycle for each unique 
      group of content items.

      <P>This task requires you to complete the Workflow Requirements section of 
      the Requirements Definition document.&nbsp; This task discusses workflow, 
      which can be either generic workflow, or the Custom WebSite Workflow tools.&nbsp; 
      <P>You might begin the task of developing workflow by answering the 
      Workflow questions in the Questions for Gathering Client Requirements 
      document. &nbsp; 
      <P>You need to: 
      <UL type="disc">
        <LI>Determine whether this project will use the internal V-Series 
        workflow or a separate browser-based solution. 
        <LI>Develop a workflow definition for content entry and content 
        management users.&nbsp; 
        <LI>Decide whether the workflow is browser-based or built-in. </LI></UL>
      <P>Not every project uses workflow, but if this project does use workflow, 
      then you must manage the workflow for all groups, users, assets, and 
      steps. 
      <P>A workflow consists of tasks or steps arranged in the order they should 
      be carried out to accomplish a particular result. Either a user or a 
      program can perform a task. 
      <P>For example, a simple workflow for getting an article onto a web site 
      might consist of the following tasks: 
      <UL type="disc">
        <LI>Submitting the article for publication 
        <LI>Checking the accuracy and validity of the information in the article 

        <LI>Copy editing the article 
        <LI>Launching the article to a Web site </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>For each content item type, analyze the required workflow tasks, such 
      as editing and legal reviews, and which roles or groups are involved in 
      the workflow. Identify each task involved in the workflow, who is involved 
      in completing the task, what exception conditions exist, and what 
      information is needed to complete the task. 
      <P><B>Notes:</B> 
      <UL type="disc">
        <LI>Consider any workflow effects on the Comm Server. The Comm Server 
        will be an added workflow requirement that might require content to be 
        prepared for the push. An example could be that of a retailer that wants 
        to send out a discount coupon for any customer that has not made a 
        purchase within the last 60 days. 
        <LI>Define RMS workflow requirements to support campaign assets.

        this point, it is advisable to begin familiarizing yourself with the features 
        available when integrating third party products with EMC's at the 
        time that the requirements are being assembled. The kits, which are available 
        from the EMC Global Marketplace, come in three types: </P>

        <LI>Software Development Kits contain documentation, sample code, an API, 
          and object libraries. These kits provide tools for integrating with 
          some part of the StoryServer or Custom WebSite Platform, such as the Page Generator 
          or CMS. </LI>
        <LI>Product Integration Kits contain documentation, sample databases, 
          sample code, an API, and object libraries. </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>These kits provide tools for integrating a specific application (for 
        example, an application server) with EMC products. These tools will 
        be implemented during the Design and Construction phases.</P>

      <P>This task requires you to complete the Security Requirements section 
        of the Requirements Definition document. 
      <P>Answering the Content Security Questions section in the Questions for 
        Gathering Client Requirements document could be helpful. 
      <P>Describe the general security constraints to be placed on the system.&nbsp; 
        The goal is to understand the environment into which the system will be 
        deployed, and to know where unauthorized access is dangerous to the business.&nbsp; 
        Be specific about which data must be secured, and what level of security 
        is necessary for that data.&nbsp; Map the content to the permissions or 
        roles that have access to it. 
      <P>Every engagement should address security at some level. Take into consideration 
        the CMA, CDA, any external interfaces, and any third party tools on security.&nbsp; 
        Map the content to applicable permissions or roles. 
      <P>As with performance requirements, unreasonable security requirements 
        can inflate the cost of the site, and extend the development schedule 
        beyond acceptable boundaries. 
      <P>It is important to be aware of those vulnerabilities that are most widely 
        known, apply the appropriate patches, and have a program for monitoring 
        possible security breaches.&nbsp; Ultimately, this is the responsibility 
        of the site's owner and administrators.&nbsp; However, when in a consulting 
        role, it is wise to educate the client to the risks and how best to mitigate 
        them. &nbsp; 
      <P>A simple example of a security requirement could be the following: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>"It is a requirement that all users must change their initially-assigned 
          passwords immediately after their first logins.&nbsp; The initial password 
          cannot be reused."</P>

      <P>This task requires you to complete the Performance Requirements section 
      of the Requirements Definition document. 
      <P>Performance is generally a function of good design and proper 
      architecture; however, there might be some specific performance criteria 
      that are necessary to make the system usable.&nbsp; 
      <P>For example, in an online trading system the timeliness of submitted 
      transactions can affect the actual success of the transaction.&nbsp; For 
      such a system, there might be a literal constraint on how long a trader 
      has to get a transaction submitted before the offer times out.&nbsp; 
      Document these constraints here. 
      <P>The performance requirements must be literal and unambiguous. &nbsp; 
      Words like "fast" or "prompt" leave room for disagreement later. 
      <P>Consider the following while writing this section: 
      <UL type="disc">
        <LI><!--3.17.1:-->Define quantifiable measures of performance. 
        <LI><!--3.17.2:-->Benchmark the customer's current system for eventual 
        comparison with delivered EMC site. 
        <LI><!--3.17.3:-->Establish a page throughput metric. 
        <LI><!--3.17.4:-->Establish a page response time metric. 
        <LI><!--3.17.5:-->Establish e-commerce transaction throughput metric. In 
        some instances, e-commerce transactions might be querying a database or 
        interfacing with a backend system. 
        <LI><!--3.17.6:-->Establish total number of users as a metric. 
        <LI><!--3.17.7:-->Quantify new users per time unit as a metric. 
        <LI>Any third-party performance issues. 
        <LI>Check an Internet audience measurement service, such as that provided 
          by <A href="http://netratings.com/">NetRatings</A>, which provides free 
          ratings for the most popular Internet sites, for ratings on comparable 
          sites. 
        <LI>Range of systems, infrastructure, and processes involved 
        <LI>Complexity of technologies 
        <LI>Possible lack of available skills, testing software, processes, or 
        focus 
        <LI>Need for rapid online deployment with minimal time for performance 
        testing </LI></UL>
      <P>Determine the client's performance expectations in terms of: 
      <UL type="disc">
        <LI>Latency or response time. Identify data latency timeframes for 
        collecting and analyzing RMS data.&nbsp; Even if data is collected 
        daily, it might get processed weekly.&nbsp; Find out if that meets the 
        client's needs. 
        <LI>Duration of workflow 
        <LI>Potential number of pages served per hour 
        <LI>Potential number of concurrent users 
        <LI>Page throughput, number of users, or peak vs. average load.&nbsp; 
        <LI>What is the profile during the day?&nbsp;During the night?&nbsp; 
        </LI></UL>
      <P>Plan extra time for testing, iterations, and tuning to mitigate 
      performance risks.&nbsp; This is often in the order of person-weeks, and 
      can involve a specialist from the Performance Advanced Service. 
      <P>Define the availability requirements. If the application must be 
      available 24x7, you will need to plan for redundancy and failover 
      mechanisms to support the availability requirements. 
      <P>Identify the client's projected needs for growth and scalability of the 
      system.&nbsp; Failure to take these requirements into consideration can 
      have a seriously negative effect on performance over time. 
      <P>For many clients, high performance is key to business success; poor 
      performance can cost the client a lot in terms of customers, investors, 
      and advertisers.&nbsp; Poor performance can have a detrimental effect on 
      customers, investors, and advertisers.&nbsp; Conversely, setting 
      unrealistic performance goals can inflate the site cost and expand the 
      development schedule beyond acceptable boundaries. </P></TD></TR><!-- Row inserted for space -->

      <P>This task requires you to answer the Technical Questions in the 
      Questions for Gathering Client Requirements document, and then use those 
      answers to fill-in the Hardware Recommendations section of the 
      Requirements Definition document. 
      <P>With a clear understanding of the business and performance 
      requirements, refine the initial hardware scoping done in the System 
      Architecture document in Task 1.9. Now in Section 4, Hardware 
      Recommendations, in the Requirements Definition Document, describe the 
      recommended hardware configuration based on the performance and functional 
      requirements.&nbsp; These preliminary recommendations will allow the 
      customer to acquire hardware items that have long order times.&nbsp; The 
      hardware configuration will not be finalized until after the application 
      architecture is designed in Phase 3.&nbsp; Final hardware sizing will 
      depend on the percentage of caching done in the application, and the 
      caching strategy has not been finalized at this point. 
      <P>Another important consideration that should be addressed at this point 
      is system availability and redundancy. If the site has a 7x24 requirement, 
      system failover for the application servers and all subsystems need to 
      taken into consideration. While the actual design of the failover systems 
      will be addressed in the Design Phase, the additional hardware 
      requirements should be considered at this point, again due to the lead 
      times required to acquire some types of hardware. </P></TD></TR><!-- Row inserted for space -->

      <P>This task requires you to conduct a session in which you review each

      <P>The signed Requirements Definition is an agreement between the 
      development team and the customer that the known requirements have been 
      collected, accurately documented and prioritized. This agreement does not 
      necessarily mean that all of the documented requirements will be part of 
      the delivered application. Sign-off on the Functional Spec and final 
      schedule at the end of the Design phase serves as the agreement with the 
      customer on what will be included in the application, and the associated 
      delivery dates. 
      <P>The signed Requirements Definition document becomes the baseline and 
      the development roadmap for the site that will be developed.&nbsp; Any 
      changes to the signed Requirements Definition document must be made 
      through the change management process.&nbsp; It is very important that 
      everyone involved with the project completely understand the content of 
      the Requirements Definition document, the significance of the document 
      sign-off, and the way the change management process works.
